# PWA Fixes Verification

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Maximum Update Depth Exceeded Error

**Problem**: Infinite loop in useEffect hooks causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- `useFeatures` hook had unstable dependencies causing `loadFeatures` callback to recreate on every render
- Main page `loadDashboardData` callback was being recreated unnecessarily

**Solution**:
- Added `useRef` to track loading state and prevent concurrent calls
- Memoized `currentUserId` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Stabilized dependencies in `useCallback` hooks
- Added proper loading guards

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useFeatures.ts` - Fixed infinite loop in feature loading
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Fixed dashboard data loading dependencies

### 2. PWA vs Website Design Differences

**Problem**: Different visual appearance between PWA and website versions.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing PWA-specific CSS styles
- Inconsistent viewport and meta tag handling
- No safe area insets for PWA mode

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive PWA-specific CSS in `globals.css`
- Created `PWAWrapper` component to handle PWA detection and styling
- Updated layout with proper PWA meta tags
- Added safe area insets support
- Ensured consistent glassmorphism and gradient effects

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added PWA-specific styles
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added PWA meta tags and wrapper
- `src/components/PWAWrapper.tsx` - New component for PWA handling
