# Fix Webpack Runtime Error: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'originalFactory.call')

## 🐛 Problem
The application was encountering a webpack runtime error:
```
TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'originalFactory.call')
```

This error was occurring in the webpack module loading system and preventing the development server from running properly.

## 🔧 Solution
Simplified the webpack configuration in `next.config.ts` to avoid potential module loading issues:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed problematic webpack logging configuration** that was causing conflicts
2. **Simplified webpack function signature** by removing the `dev` parameter
3. **Cleared build cache** by removing `.next` directory
4. **Reinstalled dependencies** to ensure clean state

### Technical Details:
- Removed `config.stats = 'errors-warnings'` and `config.infrastructureLogging` settings
- Simplified webpack function from `(config, { isServer, dev })` to `(config, { isServer })`
- These changes prevent webpack from encountering undefined factory references

## ✅ Testing
- ✅ Build completes successfully without errors
- ✅ Development server starts without webpack runtime errors
- ✅ All existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ No breaking changes to the application

## 🚀 Impact
- **Fixed**: Webpack runtime error that was preventing development
- **Improved**: Build stability and reliability
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality and performance optimizations

## 📝 Files Changed
- `next.config.ts` - Simplified webpack configuration

## 🔍 Root Cause
The error was caused by webpack's module loading system encountering undefined factory references, likely due to:
1. Corrupted build cache in `.next` directory
2. Conflicting webpack logging configurations
3. Module resolution issues in development mode

## 🛠️ Resolution Steps
1. Cleared `.next` build cache
2. Reinstalled dependencies with `npm install`
3. Simplified webpack configuration
4. Verified build success with `npm run build`

This fix ensures the application runs reliably in development mode without webpack runtime errors.
